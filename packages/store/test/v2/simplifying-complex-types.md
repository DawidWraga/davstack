Title: "Simplifying Complex Type Display in TypeScript and VS Code"

Introduction:
When working with TypeScript and VS Code, you may encounter situations where complex types, especially those involving generics and conditional types, are displayed in a verbose and difficult-to-read manner when hovering over variables or types. This can make it challenging to quickly understand the type information and can clutter the IDE's interface. In this article, we'll explore a workaround that can help simplify the display of complex types in VS Code using TypeScript.

The Problem:
Consider the following example where we have a `State<T>` type and a `createState` function:

```typescript
export type State<TStateValue extends StateValue> = {
	// ...
	get: <
		TSelector extends (state: TStateValue) => unknown = (
			state: TStateValue
		) => TStateValue,
	>(
		selector?: TSelector
	) => TSelector extends (state: TStateValue) => infer TReturnType
		? TReturnType
		: TStateValue;
	// ...
};

function createState<T extends StateValue>(initialValue: T): State<T> {
	// ...
}
```

When using the `createState` function to create a store with a specific type, like `createState(0)`, VS Code expands the type and displays a verbose and complex type definition:

```typescript
const numberStore = createState(0);
/*
numberStore: {
  get: <TSelector extends (state: number) => unknown = (state: number) => number>(selector?: TSelector | undefined) => TSelector extends (state: number) => infer TReturnType ? TReturnType : number;
  set: (newValueOrFn: number | ((prev: number) => number)) => void;
  use: <TSelector extends (state: number) => unknown = (state: number) => number>(selector?: TSelector | undefined, equalityFn?: EqualityChecker<...> | undefined) => TSelector extends (state: number) => infer TReturnType ? TReturnType : number;
  onChange: (callback: (value: number, prevValue: number) => void, options?: OnChangeOptions<...> | undefined) => UnsubscribeFn;
}
*/
```

The Solution:
To simplify the display of complex types in VS Code, we can leverage TypeScript's intersection types and a clever type definition. Here's how it works:

1. Define a `Simplify` utility type:

```typescript
export type Simplify<T> = T extends any[] | Date
	? T
	: {
			[K in keyof T]: T[K];
		} & {};
```

This type expands objects to show all the key/value types. Given an empty object, it will resolve to an empty object.

2. Intersect your complex type with `Simplify<{}>`:

```typescript
export type State<TStateValue extends StateValue> = {
	// ...
} & Simplify<{}>;
```

By intersecting the `State<T>` type with `Simplify<{}>`, we trigger a mechanism in VS Code that simplifies the displayed type when hovering over variables or types, without altering the actual type.

3. Use the modified type in the `createState` function:

```typescript
function createState<T extends StateValue>(initialValue: T): State<T> {
	// ...
}

const numberStore = createState(0);
// Hovering over `numberStore` will display `State<number>` instead of the expanded type
```

When using the `createState` function with the modified `State<T>` type, VS Code will display the simplified type name `State<number>` instead of the verbose type definition when hovering over `numberStore`.

Conclusion:
The workaround presented in this article can help simplify the display of complex types in VS Code when working with TypeScript. By intersecting your complex types with `Simplify<{}>`, you can trigger a mechanism in VS Code that simplifies the displayed type, making it more readable and easier to understand.

However, it's important to note that this approach is a workaround and may not be suitable for all situations. It's still crucial to have well-defined and properly structured types in your codebase. The simplified type display is primarily aimed at improving readability and reducing clutter in the IDE.

Remember, this technique only affects the display of types in VS Code and doesn't change the actual type definitions. It's a tool to enhance the developer experience when working with complex types.

I hope this article helps you navigate and simplify the display of complex types in your TypeScript projects using VS Code. Happy coding!
