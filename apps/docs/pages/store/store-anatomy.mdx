# Store Anatomy

Stores allow you to encapsulate state and logic in single, reusable object.

### Why Encapsulate State and Logic in the Store?

The store definition is **self-contained**, allowing you to **reuse** it to create **multiple instances** of the same store with the same extensions and effects eg for [Local State Management](/store/local-state-management).

Additionally, it helps to keep your code organized and provides useful autocompletion and type checking.

### Example

```tsx filename="stores/user-store.ts"
import { store } from '@davstack/store';

export const userStore = store()
	.state({
		name: 'John',
		age: 25,
	})
	.computed((store) => ({
		fullName: () => `${store.name.use()} Doe`,
	}))
	.actions((store) => ({
		incrementAge() {
			store.age.set(store.age.get() + 1);
		},
	}));

// fully typed
userStore.incrementAge();
userStore.name.get();
```

### Core store concepts:

- **State**: a single source of truth that can be accessed and modified.
- **Actions**: functions that modify the state.
- **Computed Properties**: derived values that are updated when the state changes.

### Additional store concepts:

- **Extensions**: allow you to assign any additional properties to the store, while keeping the store definition self-contained and reusable. (see [extensions](/store/extensions))
- **Effects**: side effects that run when the state changes, such as logging or API calls. (See [onChange and effects](/store/onChange-and-effects))
- **Store Options**: additional options such as middlewares, devtools, and state persistence. (See [options](/store/options-and-middleware))
