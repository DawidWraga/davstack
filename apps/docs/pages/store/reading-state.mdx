# Accessing State

Davstack Store provides two main methods for accessing state: `get` and `use`.

It is important to understand how to use these methods in order to optimize performance and avoid unnecessary re-renders in your application.

### The `get` Method

Use `get` to retrieve the current value of a state property without subscribing to changes.

This is useful eg for accessing state within callbacks or event handlers.

```tsx
import { store } from '@davstack/store';

const countStore = store(0);

function onSave() {
	const count = countStore.get();
	console.log(`Saving count: ${count}`);
}
```

### The `use` Method

The `use` method is a React hook that subscribes to changes in a specific part of the store and causes the component to re-render whenever that part of the state changes.

```tsx
import { store } from '@davstack/store';

const countStore = store(0);

function Counter() {
	// will re-render whenever count changes
	const count = countStore.use();
	return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
}
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
	Avoid using `use` on the entire store or large portions of the state unless
	necessary, as it may lead to excessive re-renders and performance issues.
</Callout>

### Nested Methods

You can use the `get` and `use` methods to access deeply nested state properties.

```tsx
import { store } from '@davstack/store';

const userStore = store({
	name: 'John',
	age: 25,
	address: {
		street: '123 Main St',
		city: 'Anytown',
	},
});
const city = userStore.address.city.get();
```

### Minimizing Re-Renders

To optimize performance and minimize unnecessary re-renders, it is best practice to use the `use` method on the most specific property you need within a component.

```tsx
const userStore = store({
	name: 'John',
	age: 25,
	address: {
		street: '123 Main St',
		city: 'Anytown',
	},
});

function UserProfile() {
	const name = userStore.name.use();
	return <div>Name: {name}</div>;
}
```

In this example, the `UserProfile` component only subscribes to changes in the `name` property. Changes to other properties like `age` or `address` will not trigger a re-render of this component.

## Computed Properties

Computed properties, defined using the `computed` method, can also be accessed using `get` and `use`. However, they cannot be directly modified using `set` or `assign`.

```tsx
const fullName = userStore.fullName.get();
const fullName = userStore.fullName.use();
```
