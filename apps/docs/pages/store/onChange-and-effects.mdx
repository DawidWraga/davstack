# `onChange` and `effects`

Davstack Store provides `onChange` and `effects` to manage side effects and state changes in a predictable way.

It is important to understand how to use these features **TOGETHER** to create a robust state management system.

tldr: you can use `onChange` to subscribe to state changes and `effects` to encapsulate side effects.

### Usage example

```tsx
import { store } from '@davstack/store';

const userStore = store({
	name: 'John',
	age: 25,
}).effects((store) => ({
	logChanges: () => store.onChange(console.log),
}));
```

## `onChange` Method

The `onChange` method callback is called whenever the state changes and can be used to trigger side effects.
This is useful for scenarios like logging, syncing with external systems, or complex state-driven effects.

### Usage

Subscribe to state changes with `onChange`. It returns an unsubscribe function to prevent memory leaks.

```tsx
const countStore = store(0);
const unsubscribe = countStore.onChange((newVal, oldVal) =>
	console.log(`Changed from ${oldVal} to ${newVal}`)
);
```

#### Selective State Changes

Use `onChange` on specific store segments to only run the callback when those parts change.

```tsx
const unsubscribe = userStore.name.onChange(console.log);
```

### Dependencies (`deps`)

Specify `deps` to react only to certain state parts. It can be a keys array or a function returning dependencies.

```tsx
const unsubscribe = store.onChange(callback, { deps: ['name '] });
```

```tsx
const unsubscribe = store.onChange(callback, {
	deps: (state) => [state.name],
});
```

You can subscribe to deeply nested changes inside the deps callback eg `state => [state.user.address.street]`

#### Immediate Invocation

Use `fireImmediately` to trigger the callback immediately with the current state.

```tsx
const unsubscribe = countStore.onChange(console.log, { fireImmediately: true });
```

#### Custom Equality Checker

Control callback invocation with a custom equality function. If it returns `true`, the callback does not fire.

```tsx
const unsubscribe = countStore.onChange(console.log, {
	equalityChecker: (newState, oldState) =>
		newState.someValue === oldState.someValue,
});
```

## Effects

The `store.effects` method allows you to **encapsule** the logic related to state changes, making it easily testable and reusable.

They enable you to bind logic to the specific store instance, which makes it possible to have multiple instances of the store (see [local state management](/store/local-state-management))

### Defining and Using Effects

Define effects within the store by returning a object similar to actions but each callback should use the `.onChange` method to subscribe to state changes.

```tsx
const countStore = store(0).effects((store) => ({
	logChanges: () => store.onChange(console.log),
}));
```

### Effect Methods and Subscriptions

**The effects are automatically subscribed to when the store is created, so it is unlikely that you will need to use this.**

However, you can manually access the effects eg for testing using `store._effects.effectName()`.

```tsx
const unsub = countStore._effects.logChanges();
```

Additionally, you can subscribe/unsubscribe from all of the store's effects

```tsx
// subscribe to all the stores effects
countStore.subscribeToEffecs();

// unsubscribe from all the stores effects
countStore.unsubscribeFromEffects();
```

These methods are used under the hood of `createStoreContext` to make multiple instances of the store work correctly.

Here is a super simplified version of `createStoreContext` to show how the effects are unsubscribed from when the component is unmounted

```tsx
export function createStoreContext(store) {
	const Provider = () => {
		const storeInstance = React.useRef(store.create(localinitialState));

		React.useEffect(() => {
			const instance = storeInstance.current;
			insatnce.subscribeToEffecs();
			return () => {
				instance.unsubscribeFromEffects();
			};
		}, []);

		return (
			<Context.Provider value={storeInstance.current}>
				{children}
			</Context.Provider>
		);
	};
}
```
