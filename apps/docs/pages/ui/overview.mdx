# Davstack UI

Plans for this package:

- Extension of shadcn/ui
- Makes react-hook-form + shadcn/ui much more easier to use, WITHOUT sacrificing flexibility
- Comprensive library of snippets for common form components
- Dialog manager
- Slot components

Much of the code in this package has already been written while building [Ream](https://reamapp.com), but it is currently in a private repository.

I will be working on this package in the coming weeks. If you are interested in this package, please join the discord server and let me know!
